# Sublime Text Launcher

A simple bash script that ensures a new instance of Sublime Text 3 is launched per workspace.

NOTE: This has been tested in Cinnamon as well as Ubuntu/Gnome. Chances are if you're not using one of these, you'll have to adapt this.


## Dependencies

Needs `wmctrl` to work. Also, Sublime Text 3 :)


## Installation

Copy the script anywhere that's in your PATH.

Add a new launcher for the script in `~/.local/share/applications` (one is provided in `Launcher/.local/share/applications`).

Use this new launcher instead of the default Sublime Text launcher to open your text files
